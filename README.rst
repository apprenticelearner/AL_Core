	:alt: Documentation Status

The Apprentice Learner Architecture provides a framework for modeling and simulating learners working educational technologies. There are three general GitHub repositories for the AL Project: 

1. **AL_Core** (this repository), which is the core library for learner modeling used to configure and instantiate agents and author their background knowledge. 
2. **AL_Train** (https://github.com/apprenticelearner/AL_Train), which contains code for interfacing AL agents with CTAT-HTML tutors and running training experiments.
3. **AL_Outerloop** (https://github.com/apprenticelearner/AL_Outerloop), which provides additional functionality to AL_Train simulating adaptive curricula.

Installation
============

To install the AL_Core library, `clone the respository <https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository>`_ to your machine using the GitHub deskptop application or by running the following command in a terminal / command line:

.. code-block:: bash

	git clone https://github.com/apprenticelearner/AL_Core 


Navigate to the directory where you cloned AL_Core in a terminal / command line and run:

.. code-block:: bash

	python -m pip install -e .

Next, go to the `pytorch setup guide <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`_ and follow the steps specified for your operating system and environment to install pytorch.

Finally, change directory to AL_Core/django and run the migrations for the django configuration:

.. code-block:: bash

	cd AL_Core/django/
	python manage.py migrate


Everything should now be fully installed and ready.

Examples
========

We have created a number of examples to demonstrate basic usage of the Appentice Learner that make use of this repository as well as `AL_Train <https://github.com/apprenticelearner/AL_Core>`_. These can be found on the `examples page <https://github.com/apprenticelearner/AL_Core/wiki/Examples>`_ of the wiki.
